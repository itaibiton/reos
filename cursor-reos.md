# REOS — Real Estate, One System

## One-liner
An end-to-end platform connecting US investors with Israeli real estate and coordinating the full deal flow across brokers, mortgage advisors, and lawyers.

## Problem
- Cross-border real estate is fragmented across WhatsApp, email, and spreadsheets.
- Investors struggle to find trusted providers and track deal progress.
- Service providers lack qualified, intent-driven leads and unified client context.

## Solution
REOS centralizes property discovery, team building, and deal execution in one workflow, with real-time collaboration and AI guidance grounded in investor profiles and platform data.

## How It Works
DISCOVER → MATCH → TRANSACT → CLOSE

## Core Value
