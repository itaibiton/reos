<objective>
Wire the new HowItWorks and FAQ components into the landing page by adding barrel exports and placing them in the correct position within the page component order.

Purpose: Both new sections become visible on the landing page in the right sequence, completing Phase 53 integration.
Output: Updated index.ts barrel exports and page.tsx with both new sections rendered.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add barrel exports and wire components into landing page</name>
  <files>src/components/newlanding/index.ts, src/app/[locale]/(main)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Update barrel export (index.ts)**

Add two new export lines to `src/components/newlanding/index.ts`:
```typescript
export { HowItWorks } from "./HowItWorks";
export { FAQ } from "./FAQ";
```

Place them BEFORE the `Footer` export (which is typically last) to maintain logical section order.

**Step 2: Update landing page (page.tsx)**

In `src/app/[locale]/(main)/page.tsx`:

1. Add `HowItWorks` and `FAQ` to the import destructuring from `"@/components/newlanding"`
2. Place them in the JSX between `Stats` and `CTA` in this order:
   - `<Stats />`
   - `<HowItWorks />` (NEW)
   - `<FAQ />` (NEW)
   - `<CTA />`

The updated file should look like:
```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import {
  Hero,
  SocialProof,
  Features,
  Automation,
  Testimonials,
  Stats,
  HowItWorks,
  FAQ,
  CTA,
} from "@/components/newlanding";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "REOS - Real Estate Operating System",
  description:
    "The all-in-one real estate operating system connecting US investors with Israeli properties. From discovery to closing, all in one platform.",
};

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Hero />
      <SocialProof />
      <Features />
      <Automation />
      <Testimonials />
      <Stats />
      <HowItWorks />
      <FAQ />
      <CTA />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Rationale for placement:**
- HowItWorks after Stats: Stats shows platform credibility (numbers), then HowItWorks explains the process
- FAQ after HowItWorks: Users who understand the process then get answers to remaining questions
- Both before CTA: FAQ's "Still have questions?" links to contact, then CTA provides final conversion push

  <done>Both HowItWorks and FAQ are exported from barrel file and rendered in landing page between Stats and CTA sections. Page compiles without TypeScript errors.</done>

  <what-built>Complete Phase 53: Two new landing page sections (How It Works + FAQ) with i18n, scroll animations, and JSON-LD structured data</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000/en in browser
3. Scroll down the landing page past Stats section
4. **Verify How It Works section:**
   - See "How It Works" heading with subheading text
   - See 4 numbered steps in a row (desktop) or stacked (mobile)
   - Each step has an icon circle with number badge, title, and description
   - On desktop, see a horizontal connector line between step circles
   - Section animates in on scroll (fade up + stagger)
   - CTA button "Start Investing Today" at bottom
5. **Verify FAQ section:**
   - See "Frequently Asked Questions" heading
   - See two tabs: "For Investors" / "For Service Providers"
   - Click "For Investors" tab: See questions grouped by category (Trust & Safety, Process, Cost & Pricing)
   - Click multiple questions to expand -- they should open INDEPENDENTLY (not close when another opens)
   - Click "For Service Providers" tab: See provider-specific questions
   - See "Still have questions?" CTA at bottom with "Contact our team" button
6. **Verify Hebrew:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/he
   - Both sections should show Hebrew text
   - Layout should be RTL (step number badges on left side, text right-aligned)
7. **Verify JSON-LD:**
   - View page source (Ctrl+U) and search for "FAQPage"
   - Should see `<script type="application/ld+json">` with FAQPage schema containing all questions
8. **Verify no regressions:**
   - Hero, SocialProof, Features, Automation, Testimonials, Stats, and CTA sections still render correctly
   - Page scroll is smooth, no layout jumps

<verification>
1. `grep 'HowItWorks' src/components/newlanding/index.ts` confirms barrel export
2. `grep 'FAQ' src/components/newlanding/index.ts` confirms barrel export
3. Page renders all sections in order: Hero > SocialProof > Features > Automation > Testimonials > Stats > HowItWorks > FAQ > CTA
4. Both sections show correctly in English and Hebrew
5. FAQ accordion allows independent expand/collapse
6. JSON-LD structured data present in page source
7. No regressions in existing landing sections
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Landing page renders all 9 sections in correct order
- HowItWorks shows 4 steps with animations and CTA
- FAQ shows tabbed, categorized questions with independent accordion
- Both sections work in EN and HE
- JSON-LD FAQPage schema in page source
- No layout or animation regressions
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/53-landing-page-sections/53-03-SUMMARY.md`
