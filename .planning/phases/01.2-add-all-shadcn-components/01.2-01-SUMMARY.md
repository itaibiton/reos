# Phase 1.2 Plan 1: Shadcn Components Summary

**Installed complete Shadcn/ui component library (53 components) for REOS platform.**

## Accomplishments

- Installed all available Shadcn/ui components using `npx shadcn@latest add --all --yes`
- Fixed resizable.tsx to use Hugeicons instead of lucide-react for consistency
- Verified all 15 critical components needed for Phases 2-4 are present
- Build passes without errors

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ui/*.tsx` - 53 component files total including:
  - **Layout**: sidebar, navigation-menu, breadcrumb, separator, scroll-area, resizable
  - **Forms**: form, select, checkbox, radio-group, switch, textarea, slider, input-otp, input-group
  - **Feedback**: alert, sonner (toast), progress, skeleton, spinner
  - **Overlays**: dialog, sheet, drawer, popover, tooltip, hover-card, context-menu, dropdown-menu, alert-dialog
  - **Data Display**: table, avatar, badge, calendar, chart, accordion, collapsible, tabs, carousel, item
  - **Navigation**: menubar, command, pagination, toggle, toggle-group, kbd
  - **Utility**: empty, field, button-group, aspect-ratio
- `src/components/ui/resizable.tsx` - Fixed to use Hugeicons (DragDropVerticalIcon) and correct react-resizable-panels exports
- `package.json` - Added @radix-ui/* dependencies and other component dependencies

## Decisions Made

- **Kept lucide-react installed**: Shadcn components use lucide-react internally by default. Rather than migrating all 19 components to Hugeicons, kept lucide-react for Shadcn internals while using Hugeicons for custom layout components.
- **Fixed resizable.tsx manually**: The component had incorrect import syntax for react-resizable-panels v4 (uses `Group` not `PanelGroup`). Also migrated its single icon to Hugeicons for consistency with our layout components.

## Issues Encountered

- **react-resizable-panels export issue**: The library exports `Group`, `Panel`, `Separator` not `PanelGroup`, `Panel`, `PanelResizeHandle`. Fixed by using aliased imports.
- **lucide-react dependency**: Initially thought removed, but was still present. Kept it since Shadcn components depend on it.

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for Phase 2: Authentication (Clerk integration). All required components available:
- Dialog, Form, Alert, Toast (sonner) for auth flows
- Avatar, Badge, Tabs for user profiles
- Table, Pagination, Sheet for marketplace views
