# Phase 1.3 Plan 1: Design System Page Summary

**Created design system documentation page showcasing all Shadcn/ui components with interactive examples.**

## Accomplishments

- Created `/design-system` route with organized component showcases
- Implemented 5 category tabs: Buttons & Inputs, Layout, Feedback, Overlays, Data Display
- Added interactive examples for 25+ components including dialogs, sheets, dropdowns, tooltips
- Fixed Radix UI scroll-lock issue causing scrollbar to disappear on Select open

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/design-system/layout.tsx` - Simple container layout for design system page
- `src/app/design-system/page.tsx` - Main page with all component showcases organized by category
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added Radix scroll-lock override to prevent scrollbar disappearing

## Decisions Made

- Used Tabs component for category organization (5 categories)
- Kept examples simple and functional for developer reference
- Fixed Radix scroll-lock with CSS override outside @layer for higher specificity

## Issues Encountered

- **Spinner size prop**: Spinner component doesn't accept `size` prop, fixed by using `className="size-X"` instead
- **Scrollbar disappearing**: Radix UI's scroll-lock hides scrollbar when Select opens. Fixed with CSS override targeting `body[data-scroll-locked]` with `overflow: visible !important`

## Next Phase Readiness
