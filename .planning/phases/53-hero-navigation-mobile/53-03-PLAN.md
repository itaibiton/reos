<objective>
Adjust navigation scroll animation thresholds for mobile and verify complete mobile responsiveness.

Purpose: The scroll animation that adjusts nav padding/border-radius may need different thresholds on mobile due to smaller viewports and faster touch scrolling. Final verification ensures no regressions and all requirements are met.

Output: Adjusted scroll thresholds in Navigation.tsx and verified mobile-responsive Hero and Navigation.

  <name>Task 1: Adjust Navigation Scroll Animation for Mobile</name>
  <files>src/components/newlanding/Navigation.tsx</files>
  <action>
Review and adjust the scroll animation thresholds for mobile (NAV-M07):

1. **Current scroll thresholds** (in handleScroll):
   - scrollingDown && currentScrollY > 100 -> setScrolled(true)
   - !scrollingDown && currentScrollY < 80 -> setScrolled(false)

2. **Mobile considerations**:
   - These thresholds are reasonable for mobile
   - Touch scrolling is faster, but 100px is still a small amount
   - Keep the same thresholds for consistency across devices

3. **Padding animation on mobile**:
   - Current animation reduces padding when scrolled
   - On mobile, the padding difference is less noticeable
   - Consider reducing the animation intensity on mobile:

   Update the animate values to be mobile-responsive:
   ```jsx
   animate={{
     paddingLeft: scrolled ? "0px" : "16px",   // Reduced from 24px on mobile
     paddingRight: scrolled ? "0px" : "16px",  // Reduced from 24px on mobile
     paddingTop: scrolled ? "0px" : "12px",    // Reduced from 16px on mobile
   }}
   ```

   Better approach - use CSS media query behavior by making initial padding responsive:
   - The motion.div animation values are fixed, which is fine
   - The visual difference on mobile is subtle and acceptable
   - NO CHANGE NEEDED if current animation looks good on mobile testing

4. **Alternative: Disable padding animation on mobile**:
   - If animation feels janky on mobile, could conditionally disable
   - But Framer Motion padding animation should be smooth
   - Keep as-is unless testing reveals issues
  </action>

Test scroll animation on mobile viewport (375px):
1. Scroll down slowly - nav should transition to scrolled state smoothly
2. Scroll up - nav should transition back to unscrolled state
3. No janky animations or visual glitches
4. Animation timing feels natural on touch scroll
  </verify>
  <done>
Scroll animation thresholds reviewed and confirmed appropriate for mobile.
Animation smooth on mobile viewports.

  <what-built>
Complete mobile responsive Hero section and Navigation with hamburger menu:

**Hero changes (53-01):**
- Text sizing: 3xl (mobile) -> 5xl (768px+) -> 7xl (1024px+)
- Stats grid: 1 column (< 640px) -> 2x2 (640px+) -> 4 columns (768px+)
- CTA buttons: stacked (< 640px) -> horizontal (640px+)
- Dashboard mockup: scaled height, hidden sidebar on mobile

**Navigation changes (53-02):**
- Hamburger menu visible on mobile (< 768px)
- Slide-in Sheet from left with smooth animation
- Platform/Solutions as accordion items
- 44px+ touch targets on all menu items
- Menu closes on link click or outside tap
- "Log in" hidden below 640px in header
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Test at multiple viewports using browser DevTools or real devices:

**1. Small phone (320px - iPhone SE):**
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Hero heading readable (not cut off)
- [ ] Stats in 1 column
- [ ] CTAs stacked vertically
- [ ] Hamburger menu visible
- [ ] "Log in" NOT visible in header
- [ ] "Get Started" visible in header

**2. Standard phone (375px - iPhone):**
- [ ] All above plus
- [ ] Mobile menu opens/closes smoothly
- [ ] Accordion items work correctly
- [ ] Touch targets feel adequate

**3. Large phone (414px - iPhone Plus):**
- [ ] Same checks as above
- [ ] Stats may be 2x2 or still 1 column

**4. Tablet (640px - breakpoint):**
- [ ] Stats in 2x2 grid
- [ ] CTAs horizontal
- [ ] "Log in" visible in header
- [ ] Hamburger menu still visible

**5. Tablet/Desktop transition (768px):**
- [ ] Desktop navigation visible
- [ ] Hamburger menu hidden
- [ ] Stats in 4 columns
- [ ] Full hero layout

**6. Scroll animation test (any mobile viewport):**
- [ ] Scroll down - nav transitions smoothly
- [ ] Scroll up - nav reverts smoothly
- [ ] No janky animations
