key-decisions:
  - "Quick Actions appear FIRST in search results, before Users/Posts/Properties"
  - "Match scoring: exact(100) > starts-with(80) > word-boundary(70) > contains(60) > keyword-exact(50) > keyword-starts(40) > keyword-contains(30)"
  - "Limited to 5 quick action results to avoid overwhelming the dropdown"
  - "Quick Actions shown even when no backend search results (client-side filtering)"

patterns-established:

# Phase 27.2 Plan 01: Quick Actions & Pages in Search Summary

**Quick Actions integration in GlobalSearchBar enabling page navigation via search with keyword aliases and role-aware filtering**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min (verification and documentation)
- **Started:** 2026-01-19T18:45:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-19T18:48:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Users can search for app pages directly (e.g., "Set" shows Settings)
- Keyword aliases work (e.g., "config" matches Settings, "favorites" matches Saved Properties)
- Quick Actions appear FIRST in search results for discoverability
- Only pages accessible to user's role are shown (role-aware filtering)

## Task Commits

Code was committed prior to this execution:

1. **Task 1: Create search-actions helper** - `c7a67c3` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate Quick Actions into GlobalSearchBar** - `c7a67c3` (feat)

Both tasks were committed together in a single commit.

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/search-actions.ts` - QuickAction types, KEYWORD_MAPPINGS, getQuickActionsForRole(), filterQuickActions()
- `src/components/search/GlobalSearchBar.tsx` - Quick Actions CommandGroup before other search results

## Decisions Made
- Quick Actions appear FIRST in dropdown to prioritize page navigation
- Match scoring algorithm with tiered priority (exact > starts-with > word-boundary > contains > keyword)
- Client-side Quick Actions filtering independent of backend search (instant results)
- Maximum 5 quick action results to keep dropdown manageable

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - implementation was straightforward.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Global search now complete with Quick Actions for page navigation
- Phase 27.2 complete, ready for Phase 28 (final v1.3 milestone phase)
- All search features implemented: users, posts, properties, history, trending, quick actions
