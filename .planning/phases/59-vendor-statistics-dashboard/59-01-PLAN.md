# Plan 59-01: Statistics Dashboard with Deal Metrics and Broker Sales Count

## Overview

Enhance the existing analytics page with total deals count, deal status breakdown by stage, and broker-specific sales count.

## Changes

### 1. Backend Enhancement (convex/providerAnalytics.ts)
- Add `totalDeals` count (all deals assigned to provider)
- Add `cancelledDeals` count
- Add `brokerSalesCount` (broker-only: completed deals where user is assigned broker)
- Add `stageBreakdown` object mapping each stage to its deal count
- Return all new fields in analytics response

### 2. Analytics Page Enhancement (src/app/[locale]/(app)/analytics/page.tsx)
- Replace "Active Deals" card with "Total Deals" card showing breakdown subtitle
- Add "Broker Sales" card (conditionally rendered for brokers only)
- Add "Deal Status Breakdown" section with colored badges per stage
- Each badge shows stage name + count

### 3. i18n Updates (messages/en.json + messages/he.json)
- Add stats.totalDeals, stats.dealBreakdown, stats.brokerSales, stats.closedAsBroker
- Add statusBreakdown.title
- Add stages.* translations (interest, brokerAssigned, mortgage, legal, closing, completed, cancelled)
