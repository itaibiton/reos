<objective>
Upgrade provider landing pages with social proof sections, JSON-LD structured data, role-preselected CTA links, and expand from old 7 types to new 7 types with full i18n content.

Purpose: Enable service providers to discover type-specific landing pages with compelling social proof and SEO-optimized structured data (PROV-01 through PROV-11).
Output: 7 provider landing pages with hero, benefits, social proof, steps, CTA, JSON-LD, and full EN/HE i18n.

  <name>Task 1: Update provider types, add social proof section, role CTA, and JSON-LD</name>
  <files>
    src/app/[locale]/(main)/services/[type]/page.tsx
    src/app/[locale]/(main)/services/[type]/ProviderPageContent.tsx
    src/app/[locale]/(main)/services/ServicesIndexContent.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **A. Update VALID_TYPES in page.tsx:**

    Replace the current VALID_TYPES array:
    ```typescript
    const VALID_TYPES = [
      "broker",
      "lawyer",
      "appraiser",
      "mortgage-advisor",
      "entrepreneur",
      "asset-manager",
      "financial-advisor",
    ] as const;
    ```

    This removes: accountant, notary, tax-consultant
    This adds: entrepreneur, asset-manager, financial-advisor

    **B. Add JSON-LD to page.tsx:**

    Follow the pricing page pattern. Add `Script` import from "next/script" and `getTranslations` from "next-intl/server" (getTranslations is already imported). In the default export function (which is already async), add JSON-LD before rendering ProviderPageContent:

    ```typescript
    export default async function ProviderPage({
      params,
    }: {
      params: Promise<{ locale: string; type: string }>;
    }) {
      const { locale, type } = await params;

      if (!isValidType(type)) {
        notFound();
      }

      const t = await getTranslations({
        locale,
        namespace: `services.providers.${type}`,
      });

      const serviceSchema = {
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "Service",
        serviceType: t("name"),
        provider: {
          "@type": "Organization",
          name: "REOS",
          url: "https://reos.co",
        },
        areaServed: {
          "@type": "Country",
          name: "Israel",
        },
        description: t("meta.description"),
        audience: {
          "@type": "Audience",
          audienceType: "US Real Estate Investors",
        },
      };

      return (
        <>
          <Script
            id={`service-schema-${type}`}
            type="application/ld+json"
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(serviceSchema) }}
          />
          <ProviderPageContent type={type} />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    IMPORTANT: Use `"@type": "Service"` (NOT "ProfessionalService" -- deprecated by schema.org). Use `serviceType` property for the specific service name.

    **C. Add social proof section + role CTA to ProviderPageContent.tsx:**

    1. Add a `roleMap` constant mapping provider slug to sign-up role parameter:
    ```typescript
    const roleMap: Record<string, string> = {
      broker: "broker",
      lawyer: "lawyer",
      appraiser: "broker", // No specific appraiser role, default to broker
      "mortgage-advisor": "mortgage_advisor",
      entrepreneur: "investor", // Entrepreneurs sign up as investors
      "asset-manager": "broker", // Asset managers closest to broker role
      "financial-advisor": "broker", // Financial advisors closest to broker role
    };
    ```

    2. Update ALL `Link` components that point to `/sign-up` to include `?role=${roleMap[type] || "broker"}`:
    ```typescript
    href={`/${locale}/sign-up?role=${roleMap[type] || "broker"}`}
    ```

    3. Update the `providerIcons` map -- remove accountant/notary/tax-consultant entries, add:
    - entrepreneur: `Rocket` (from lucide-react)
    - "asset-manager": `PieChart` (from lucide-react)
    - "financial-advisor": `TrendingUp` (from lucide-react)

    4. Add a social proof section between Benefits and How It Works sections. Read stats from i18n:
    ```typescript
    const stats = [
      { value: t("stats.0.value"), label: t("stats.0.label") },
      { value: t("stats.1.value"), label: t("stats.1.label") },
      { value: t("stats.2.value"), label: t("stats.2.label") },
    ];
    ```

    Render as a 3-column grid of stat cards (centered text, large value, smaller label) with framer-motion stagger animation. Use the same card styling as benefits but with centered text and large font for the value.

    5. Add a testimonial quote below the stats (single featured testimonial):
    ```typescript
    const testimonial = {
      quote: t("testimonial.quote"),
      name: t("testimonial.name"),
      role: t("testimonial.role"),
    };
    ```

    Render as a blockquote with quotation marks, attribution name and role below. Style: italic text, centered, max-w-2xl, gray-600 text. Wrap in the same section as stats.

    **D. Update ServicesIndexContent.tsx:**

    Update the provider type list to match the new 7 types. Check the current implementation -- it likely iterates over a list of provider types. Update to use the new set: broker, lawyer, appraiser, mortgage-advisor, entrepreneur, asset-manager, financial-advisor.

    Also update the icon imports to match the new types (remove Calculator/Stamp/FileSpreadsheet for accountant/notary/tax-consultant, add Rocket/PieChart/TrendingUp for the new types).

    AVOID:
    - Do NOT use "@type": "ProfessionalService" in JSON-LD (deprecated)
    - Do NOT hardcode any text -- all user-facing strings must use t() translations
    - Do NOT remove the existing hero, benefits, steps, or CTA sections -- ADD social proof between benefits and steps
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` -- no TypeScript errors
    2. Run `npm run build` -- all 7 provider pages generate statically
    3. Check page source of /en/services/broker -- JSON-LD script tag with "@type": "Service" present
    4. Check CTA link on broker page -- href contains "/sign-up?role=broker"
    5. Verify stats section renders between benefits and how-it-works sections
    6. Navigate to /en/services/entrepreneur -- page loads without 404
  </verify>
  <done>
    7 provider types generate statically. Each page has hero, benefits, social proof (stats + testimonial), steps, CTA. CTA links include ?role= parameter. JSON-LD Service structured data present in page source. No broken icons or missing type mappings.

  <action>
    NOTE: Plan 55-01 already modified these files to update contact form subjects and add thank-you translations. Read the current state of the files before making changes.

    **A. Remove old provider types from i18n** (EN and HE):

    Remove these keys from `services.providers`: `accountant`, `notary`, `tax-consultant`. These types no longer exist in VALID_TYPES.

    **B. Add EN i18n for 3 new provider types** under `services.providers`:

    Add complete entries for `entrepreneur`, `asset-manager`, and `financial-advisor` following the exact same structure as the existing `broker` entry (name, shortDescription, meta.title, meta.description, heroTitle, heroDescription, benefits[3], steps[4], ctaTitle, ctaDescription, stats[3], testimonial).

    **entrepreneur:**
    - name: "Real Estate Entrepreneur"

    - ctaTitle: "Ready to build your portfolio?"
    - ctaDescription: "Join entrepreneurs already using REOS to find and close Israeli real estate deals."
    - stats: [{ value: "500+", label: "Active deals" }, { value: "$2B+", label: "Total deal value" }, { value: "92%", label: "Client satisfaction" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "REOS connected me with the right professionals and deals to build my Israeli portfolio from scratch.", name: "David R.", role: "Real Estate Entrepreneur" }

    **asset-manager:**
    - name: "Asset Manager"
    - shortDescription: "Manage Israeli real estate portfolios for clients with institutional-grade tools and local market intelligence."
    - meta.title: "Asset Managers — REOS Provider Network"
    - meta.description: "Join REOS as an asset manager and access tools, market data, and client connections for Israeli real estate portfolio management."
    - heroTitle: "Manage Israeli portfolios with institutional-grade tools"
    - heroDescription: "REOS provides asset managers with market intelligence, deal flow, and client management tools purpose-built for the Israeli real estate market."
    - benefits: 3 items focused on portfolio analytics, client acquisition, market intelligence
    - steps: 4 items (Create profile -> Access market data -> Manage client portfolios -> Scale operations)
    - ctaTitle: "Ready to scale your AUM?"
    - ctaDescription: "Join asset managers already leveraging REOS for Israeli real estate portfolio management."
    - stats: [{ value: "$5B+", label: "Assets managed" }, { value: "150+", label: "Active managers" }, { value: "35%", label: "Average portfolio growth" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "The market data and client matching on REOS transformed how we manage Israeli real estate portfolios.", name: "Sarah K.", role: "Senior Asset Manager" }

    **financial-advisor:**
    - name: "Financial Advisor"
    - shortDescription: "Guide clients through Israeli real estate investments with market insights, tax planning tools, and deal analysis."
    - meta.title: "Financial Advisors — REOS Provider Network"
    - meta.description: "Join REOS as a financial advisor and help clients navigate Israeli real estate investments with data-driven insights."
    - heroTitle: "Guide clients to smarter Israeli real estate investments"
    - heroDescription: "REOS empowers financial advisors with market analytics, deal comparisons, and client management tools to deliver expert Israeli real estate guidance."
    - benefits: 3 items focused on data-driven advice, client portfolio tools, cross-border expertise
    - steps: 4 items (Join the network -> Access analytics -> Advise clients -> Grow your practice)
    - ctaTitle: "Ready to advise on Israeli real estate?"
    - ctaDescription: "Join financial advisors already using REOS to deliver data-driven Israeli property investment guidance."
    - stats: [{ value: "1,200+", label: "Clients advised" }, { value: "$800M+", label: "Investments guided" }, { value: "98%", label: "Advisor retention" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "REOS gives me the data and tools to confidently guide my clients through Israeli real estate opportunities.", name: "Michael T.", role: "Certified Financial Advisor" }

    **C. Add stats + testimonial i18n for existing 4 provider types** (broker, lawyer, appraiser, mortgage-advisor):

    For each existing type, add `stats` array (3 items, each with value and label) and `testimonial` object (quote, name, role):

    **broker:**
    - stats: [{ value: "2,500+", label: "Active brokers" }, { value: "$1.2B", label: "Deals closed" }, { value: "4.8/5", label: "Average rating" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "REOS transformed my brokerage. The quality of investor leads is unmatched — I closed three deals in my first month.", name: "Yossi M.", role: "Licensed Real Estate Broker" }

    **lawyer:**
    - stats: [{ value: "800+", label: "Transactions completed" }, { value: "15+", label: "Years average experience" }, { value: "99%", label: "Closing success rate" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "The platform streamlines the entire legal process for cross-border transactions. My clients love the transparency.", name: "Rachel L.", role: "Real Estate Attorney" }

    **appraiser:**
    - stats: [{ value: "5,000+", label: "Appraisals completed" }, { value: "48hr", label: "Average turnaround" }, { value: "100%", label: "Licensed appraisers" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "REOS connects me with serious investors who value professional appraisals. The steady deal flow speaks for itself.", name: "Amit B.", role: "Certified Property Appraiser" }

    **mortgage-advisor:**
    - stats: [{ value: "3,200+", label: "Mortgages arranged" }, { value: "95%", label: "Approval rate" }, { value: "12+", label: "Banking partners" }]
    - testimonial: { quote: "Working with US investors through REOS has grown my practice significantly. The pre-qualified leads save me hours.", name: "Daniel S.", role: "Mortgage Advisor" }

    **D. Add HE translations for all of the above:**

    Translate all new provider types (entrepreneur, asset-manager, financial-advisor) and all stats/testimonials for all 7 types into Hebrew. Maintain the same JSON structure. Ensure RTL-appropriate text.

    Key Hebrew translations for new type names:
    - entrepreneur: "יזם נדל\"ן"
    - asset-manager: "מנהל נכסים"
    - financial-advisor: "יועץ פיננסי"

    Also remove old provider type keys (accountant, notary, tax-consultant) from HE translations.

    **E. Update services index i18n if needed:**

    Check `services.index` or `services.providers` for any list/descriptions that reference the old types (accountant, notary, tax-consultant). If ServicesIndexContent reads a list of types from i18n, update accordingly.

    IMPORTANT:
    - All stats values are placeholder/illustrative -- they are i18n content, not real-time data
    - Keep the same JSON structure as existing types (benefits as array of {title, description}, steps as array of {title, description})
    - Write compelling, specific benefit descriptions (2-3 sentences each) -- not generic filler
    - Each benefit and step must be differentiated per provider type
  </action>
