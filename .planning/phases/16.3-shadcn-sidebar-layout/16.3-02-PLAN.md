  <name>Task 1: Create ComingSoon placeholder component</name>
  <files>src/components/ComingSoon.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a reusable "Coming Soon" placeholder component:

```tsx
import { Construction } from "lucide-react";

interface ComingSoonProps {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

export function ComingSoon({ title, description }: ComingSoonProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-[400px] text-center p-6">
      <Construction className="h-16 w-16 text-muted-foreground mb-4" />
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">{title}</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground max-w-md">
        {description || "This feature is coming soon. We're working hard to bring you this functionality."}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Keep it simple - centered content with icon, title, and description.
