# REOS - Real Estate Investment, Simplified

## The Problem

**Investing in Israeli real estate is fragmented and overwhelming.**

First-time and international investors face:
- **6+ service providers** to coordinate independently (broker, mortgage advisor, lawyer, appraiser, accountant, notary)
- **No visibility** into deal progress across providers
- **Language barriers** and unfamiliar processes
- **Analysis paralysis** without expert guidance on investment decisions

The result? Missed opportunities, costly mistakes, and deals that fall through.

## Our Solution

**REOS is the all-in-one platform that orchestrates your entire real estate investment journey.**

We connect investors with vetted Israeli service providers through a single dashboard, while an AI-powered assistant guides every decision.

Lenny Sporn
Sporn Group, a boutique real-estate company based in New York. 

Prior to Co-founding the Sporn Group, Lenny was the youngest agent to earn a spot on Douglas Elliman’s Top Ten Producers List for many consecutive years. 

We pride ourselves on our ability to unlock the outstanding potential behind each of our commercial, residential, and leisure properties. Since entering the real estate industry over a decade ago, it has been a passion of mine to enhance people’s lives and environments. 

In real estate I believe it is just as vital to have a trusted relationship than only focus on the property itself. I co-founded the Sporn Group to act with integrity and always think about the bigger picture providing personalised, clear and considered advice on all areas of property.

Through our deep understanding of key markets and sectors – whether multi-family properties, Invesment sales or residential– we aim to meet and exceed your real estate objectives. We guide our clients to be proactive rather than reactive in a fast-paced and ever-changing landscape on a local, national and global level.

A true partnership is a balanced one and we are committed to making our business inclusive and diverse, if given the opportunity to perform I promise you we will do at our best and we will continue to be recognised for the value we bring.

In the past 15 years we did over $1.5 Billion in commercial & residential sales.

We recently represented Silverstein Properties in their purchase of 116 John Street, a 416-unit iconic property in Lower Manhattan in an off market deal with a purchase price of $247,500.000 I am humbled to have been provided the opportunity to be involved in such a off market landmark deal.
