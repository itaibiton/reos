## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile app | Web responsive first, native apps in future milestone |
| Hamburger menu | Research shows 40% slower task completion than bottom tabs |
| Full search bar on mobile | Takes too much header space, icon trigger is standard |
| Breadcrumbs on mobile | Screen real estate too limited |
| Pure black (#000000) dark mode | Too harsh, use dark gray instead |
| Clerk UserButton component | Want custom UI matching our design system |
