# REOS Landing Page - Services Showcase - Progress Log

## Project Started: 2026-01-19

## Goal
Build a services showcase landing page for REOS with three key sections:
1. Services Grid - Showcase REOS service offerings
2. Process Steps - Show how REOS works (timeline/steps)
3. Team Section - Team member cards with photos and bios

## Components to Build
- ServicesGrid.tsx (with ServiceCard)
- ProcessSteps.tsx (with step items)
- TeamSection.tsx (with TeamMemberCard)
- Landing page route composing all sections

## Agent Workflow
- Phase 1: prd-architect - Define requirements for each section
- Phase 2: ui-designer - Implement UI components
- Phase 3: kohelet-copywriter - Write marketing copy
- Phase 4: senior-frontend-dev - Integration and polish

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] PRD-01: Define Services Grid Requirements
- [x] PRD-02: Define Process Steps Requirements
- [x] PRD-03: Define Team Section Requirements

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - PRD Definition (COMPLETE) → Phase 2 - UI Implementation

## Progress Log:

### 2026-01-19 - PRD-01 Complete
**Task:** Define Services Grid Requirements
**Agent:** prd-architect
**Output:** `.claude/ralph/landing-page/PRD-01-services-grid.md`

Created comprehensive PRD for Services Grid component including:
- Component overview and placement strategy
- Detailed service card structure (icon, title, description, CTA)
- Complete services list with 6 REOS services (Property Management, Tenant Portal, Maintenance Tracking, Financial Analytics, Document Management, Communication Hub)
- Responsive grid layout specification (1/2/3 columns at breakpoints)
- Comprehensive interaction states (default, hover, focus, active)
- Framer Motion animation specifications (stagger reveal, scroll-triggered, hover effects)
- Full accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, WCAG AA contrast, reduced motion support)
- Responsive behavior across all breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Technical implementation details with code examples
- Testing checklist and QA requirements
- Color reference and theme integration

**Next:** UI-01 (ui-designer agent) can now implement the component based on this specification.
