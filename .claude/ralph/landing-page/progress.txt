# REOS Landing Page - Services Showcase - Progress Log

## Project Started: 2026-01-19

## Goal
Build a services showcase landing page for REOS with three key sections:
1. Services Grid - Showcase REOS service offerings
2. Process Steps - Show how REOS works (timeline/steps)
3. Team Section - Team member cards with photos and bios

## Components to Build
- ServicesGrid.tsx (with ServiceCard)
- ProcessSteps.tsx (with step items)
- TeamSection.tsx (with TeamMemberCard)
- Landing page route composing all sections

## Agent Workflow
- Phase 1: prd-architect - Define requirements for each section
- Phase 2: ui-designer - Implement UI components
- Phase 3: kohelet-copywriter - Write marketing copy
- Phase 4: senior-frontend-dev - Integration and polish

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] PRD-01: Define Services Grid Requirements
- [x] PRD-02: Define Process Steps Requirements
- [x] PRD-03: Define Team Section Requirements
- [x] UI-01: Implement Services Grid Component
- [x] UI-02: Implement Process Steps Component

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - UI Implementation

## Progress Log:

### 2026-01-19 - PRD-01 Complete
**Task:** Define Services Grid Requirements
**Agent:** prd-architect
**Output:** `.claude/ralph/landing-page/PRD-01-services-grid.md`

Created comprehensive PRD for Services Grid component including:
- Component overview and placement strategy
- Detailed service card structure (icon, title, description, CTA)
- Complete services list with 6 REOS services (Property Management, Tenant Portal, Maintenance Tracking, Financial Analytics, Document Management, Communication Hub)
- Responsive grid layout specification (1/2/3 columns at breakpoints)
- Comprehensive interaction states (default, hover, focus, active)
- Framer Motion animation specifications (stagger reveal, scroll-triggered, hover effects)
- Full accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, WCAG AA contrast, reduced motion support)
- Responsive behavior across all breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Technical implementation details with code examples
- Testing checklist and QA requirements
- Color reference and theme integration

**Next:** UI-01 (ui-designer agent) can now implement the component based on this specification.

### 2026-01-19 - PRD-02 Complete
**Task:** Define Process Steps Requirements
**Agent:** prd-architect
**Output:** `.claude/ralph/landing-page/PRD-02-process-steps.md`

Created comprehensive PRD for Process Steps component including:
- Component overview and placement strategy (after Services Grid)
- Step anatomy with number badge, icon, title, description, and key highlights
- 4 process steps defined: Create Account, Add Properties, Configure Workspace, Start Managing
- Desktop layout: Horizontal 4-column grid with connecting lines
- Tablet layout: 2x2 grid
- Mobile layout: Vertical stack with left-aligned connector line
- Detailed timeline/connector design with SVG path animations
- Interaction states (default, hover, focus)
- Comprehensive Framer Motion animation specs (stagger reveal, scroll-triggered, badge pop)
- Full accessibility requirements (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, WCAG AA compliance)
- Responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Technical specifications with TypeScript interfaces and code examples
- Testing checklist and QA requirements
- Content guidelines for future edits

**Next:** UI-02 (ui-designer agent) can now implement the component based on this specification.

### 2026-01-19 - PRD-03 Complete
**Task:** Define Team Section Requirements
**Agent:** prd-architect
**Output:** `.claude/ralph/landing-page/PRD-03-team-section.md`

Created comprehensive PRD for Team Section component including:
- Component overview and trust-building value proposition
- Team card anatomy: 128px circular avatar, name, role, 2-3 sentence bio, social links
- 4 placeholder team members with realistic roles (CEO, Head of Engineering, Lead Designer, Customer Success)
- Avatar fallback strategy using gradient backgrounds with initials
- Grid layout: 1 col (mobile), 2 col (tablet), 4 col (desktop)
- Hover effects: card scale 105%, shadow expansion, avatar ring brightens, social icon backgrounds
- Social link icons: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub (Lucide React)
- Framer Motion stagger animations on scroll
- Full accessibility requirements (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Privacy considerations for team member photos
- Testing checklist and QA requirements

**Next:** Phase 1 PRD Definition is complete. UI-01, UI-02, UI-03 can now proceed.

### 2026-01-19 - UI-01 Complete
**Task:** Implement Services Grid Component
**Agent:** ui-designer
**Output:** `src/components/landing/ServicesGrid.tsx`

Implemented production-ready ServicesGrid component:
- ServicesGrid main component with section header
- ServiceCard subcomponent for individual cards
- 6 services with icons: Property Management, Tenant Portal, Maintenance & Work Orders, Financial Analytics, Document Management, Communication Hub
