# REOS — Israeli Real Estate Investment Platform

## The Problem

Real estate investment in Israel is fragmented and complex. Investors juggle multiple service providers — brokers, mortgage advisors, lawyers — across disconnected channels. Communication happens in scattered WhatsApp groups, documents get lost in email threads, and deal progress is opaque. Service providers struggle to find qualified clients and build their professional reputation.
